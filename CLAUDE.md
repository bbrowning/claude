# Continuous Learning
- When you discover a preference, working style, environmental fact, or
  recurring correction about this user that should apply across all projects,
  add it to the Learned section at the bottom of this file.
- Keep the Learned section under 30 entries. If full, replace the least
  important entry rather than appending.
- Do not add general technical knowledge (you already know it) or
  project-specific facts (auto memory handles those).
- Do not ask permission. Keep entries to one line each.
